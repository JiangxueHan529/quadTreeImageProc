 Only works with pictures of side lengths that are a power of two.

 I realize that my -c is very expensive and time consuming.
 With my -c, I print out which compression levels were not possible.

 I realize some very low compression levels result in a picture if
 all one or very few colors, but I included them because they are
 technically possible.

 If block boxes done on uncompressed image, it will be all black.

 Sometimes multiple pictures will seem all one color at low
 compression levels.

 Our own filter is a negative filter, in which, if the filter is
 applied, we set red, blue, and green equal to 255 - red, 255 - blue,
 and 255 - green, respectively.

 Impossible compression levels: (I realize some of these, like kira,
 have possible compression levels in between .75 and .5 (like .6), but they
 are not close enough to the desired compression level for me to say
 that .75 or .5 was achieved.

 kira: .75 and .5 not possible
 kira2: .75 and .5 not possible
